# Approaches to Merging Large Sorted Files

## Problem Statement

The task is to merge multiple sorted `.dat` files into a single sorted output file. These files may be too large to fit into memory at once, so an efficient strategy is needed to handle the merging process.

## Approaches

### 1. **In-Memory Merge**
- **Description**:
    - Read all the sorted files into memory.
    - Merge them using an in-memory data structure like a list or array.
    - Sort the combined list/array and write the sorted result to the output file.
- **Pros**:
    - Simplicity: Easy to implement and understand.
    - Performance: Fast for small datasets where all data can fit into memory.
- **Cons**:
    - Memory Constraints: Inefficient or impractical for large files that exceed available memory.
    - Risk of OutOfMemoryError in Java for large datasets.

### 2. **Divide and Conquer**
- **Description**:
    - Divide the set of files into smaller groups.
    - Merge each group recursively until only one group remains.
    - Write the final merged result to the output file.
- **Pros**:
    - Scalable: Can handle larger datasets by reducing the size of each merge step.
    - More efficient than in-memory merge for large datasets.
- **Cons**:
    - Complexity: More complicated to implement, especially managing intermediate files.
    - Still requires significant memory if individual files are large.

### 3. **External Sort (Chosen Approach)**
- **Description**:
    - Read data from each sorted file incrementally, using a small buffer for each file.
    - Use a priority queue (min-heap) to merge the smallest elements from each buffer.
    - Write the smallest element to the output file and refill the buffer from the corresponding file.
- **Pros**:
    - Memory Efficient: Only a small portion of each file is loaded into memory at any time.
    - Handles Large Files: Suitable for very large datasets that don't fit into memory.
    - Scalable: Works well regardless of the number of files or their size.
- **Cons**:
    - Slightly Slower: May have a higher I/O overhead compared to in-memory processing.
    - Complex Implementation: Requires careful management of file I/O and the priority queue.

## Why External Sort was Chosen

The external sort approach was selected due to its ability to handle large files that cannot be loaded into memory all at once. In real-world scenarios, data sizes can easily exceed available memory, especially when working with large datasets in data processing and logging.

### Key Reasons:
1. **Scalability**: External sort scales efficiently with the size of the input data.
2. **Memory Efficiency**: By using a small, fixed-size buffer (Priority Queue) and processing the data incrementally, the application avoids running into memory limitations, making it robust for large files.
3. **Reliability**: This method is less prone to running into `OutOfMemoryError` exceptions, providing a more stable solution for merging large files.

Given very large files as input and no constraints on the time complexity I have chosen option 3 (External sort) as most suitable approach for this.
